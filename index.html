    Hello Internet
    <br>
    <br>
    My name is Andrew. I live in San Fransisco and work as a management consultant.
    Outside of the office I spend my time reading, climbing, and programming. Previously,
    I lived in Chapel Hill, NC where I studied computer science at the University of North Carolina.
